# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Gal Niv**, 24 years old, and Iâ€™ve been absolutely fascinated by all things tech since I can remember. From low-level bits and bytes to high-level system designs, Iâ€™m into it all! ðŸ”§ðŸ’»

### How It All Began

My tech journey started in a rather unusual wayâ€”through **game cheats**! ðŸŽ® Yep, hacking games sparked my curiosity for how things work, and that quickly turned into a passion for **vulnerability research** and **software design**.

### My Professional Path

In 2018-2019, I had the awesome opportunity to work at **Aqua Security** as a **Security Researcher**, where I dove deep into the world of cloud-native security. Since then, my journey has taken me into management, and Iâ€™m currently a **Group Manager**, where I lead multidisciplinary tech teams, helping diverse talents collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.

### What Drives Me

Whether it's tinkering with the latest tech or managing a team of bright minds, Iâ€™m all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible and bringing innovative solutions to life. ðŸš€

Letâ€™s connect and geek out over tech and leadership!
